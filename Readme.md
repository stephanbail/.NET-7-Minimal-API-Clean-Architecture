# Movie and Rating API

A feature-rich and robust RESTful API for managing movies and their ratings, built using ASP.NET Core, C#, PostgreSQL, and Dapper ORM. The API includes advanced features like pagination, sorting, and validation, as well as dependency injection and separation of concerns. This project is inspired by Nick Chapsas' course, ["From Zero to Hero: REST APIs in .NET"](https://nickchapsas.com/courses/enrolled/2022064).

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for movies
- Rate a movie for a specific user
- Retrieve movie ratings for a user
- Pagination and sorting for movie listings
- Validation for incoming requests to ensure data integrity
- Dependency injection for extensibility and maintainability
- Separation of concerns to facilitate easier code management and testing

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- .NET 7.0 SDK or later: Download from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)
- PostgreSQL: Setup via Docker Desktop and docker-compose using the compose file included in the project

#### Setting up PostgreSQL using Docker

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) if you don't have it already.

2. Navigate to the `Movies.Application` directory:

```
cd Movies.Application
```

3. Use the included `docker-compose.yml` file to set up PostgreSQL:

Path: `Movies.Application/docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3.9'

services:

  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=pguser
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeme
      - POSTGRES_DB=movies
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
```

4. Run the following command to start the PostgreSQL container:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will set up a PostgreSQL instance with the required configuration. Make sure to adjust the connection string in `appsettings.json` accordingly.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/stephanbail/.NET-7-Minimal-API-Clean-Architecture.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```
cd .NET-7-Minimal-API-Clean-Architecture
```

3. Set up the PostgreSQL database and adjust the connection string in `appsettings.json` accordingly.

4. Run the following command to restore the required packages:

```
dotnet restore
```

5. Run the following command to build the project:

```
dotnet build
```

6. Run the following command to start the API:

```
dotnet run --project Movies.Api
```

7. Open your browser or preferred API testing tool (e.g., Postman) and navigate to the API endpoints.

## Usage

The API exposes the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/movies` - Get all movies (paginated)
- `GET /api/movies/{id}` - Get a movie by ID
- `POST /api/movies` - Create a new movie
- `PUT /api/movies/{id}` - Update a movie
- `DELETE /api/movies/{id}` - Delete a movie
- `POST /api/movies/{id}/rating` - Rate a movie
- `GET /api/users/{userId}/ratings` - Get movie ratings for a user

Refer to the API documentation for detailed information on request and response formats.
