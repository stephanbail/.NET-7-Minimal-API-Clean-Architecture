# .NET 7 & C# 11 Minimal API: Mastering Clean Architecture for Modern RESTful Services

A feature-rich and robust RESTful API for managing movies and their ratings, built using ASP.NET Core, C# 11, .NET 7, PostgreSQL, and Dapper ORM. The API includes advanced features like pagination, sorting and validation, as well as dependency injection and separation of concerns. This project is inspired by Nick Chapsas' course, ["From Zero to Hero: REST APIs in .NET"](https://nickchapsas.com/courses/enrolled/2022064).

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for movies
- Rate a movie for a specific user
- Retrieve movie ratings for a user
- Pagination and sorting for movie listings
- Validation for incoming requests to ensure data integrity
- Dependency injection for extensibility and maintainability
- Separation of concerns to facilitate easier code management and testing

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- .NET 7.0 SDK or later: Download from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)
- PostgreSQL: Setup via Docker Desktop and docker-compose using the compose file included in the project

#### Setting up PostgreSQL using Docker

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) if you don't have it already.

2. Navigate to the `Movies.Application` directory:

```
cd Movies.Application
```

3. Use the included `docker-compose.yml` file to set up PostgreSQL:

Path: `Movies.Application/docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3.9'

services:

  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    restart: always
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=pguser
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeme
      - POSTGRES_DB=movies
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
```

4. Run the following command to start the PostgreSQL container:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will set up a PostgreSQL instance with the required configuration. Make sure to adjust the connection string in `appsettings.json` accordingly.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/stephanbail/net7-minimal-api-clean-architecture.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```
cd .NET-7-Minimal-API-Clean-Architecture
```

3. Set up the PostgreSQL database and adjust the connection string in `appsettings.json` accordingly.

4. Run the following command to restore the required packages:

```
dotnet restore
```

5. Run the following command to build the project:

```
dotnet build
```

6. Run the following command to start the API:

```
dotnet run --project Movies.Api
```

7. Open your browser or preferred API testing tool (e.g., Postman) and navigate to the API endpoints.

## Usage

The API exposes the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/movies` - Get all movies (paginated)
- `GET /api/movies/{id}` - Get a movie by ID
- `POST /api/movies` - Create a new movie
- `PUT /api/movies/{id}` - Update a movie
- `DELETE /api/movies/{id}` - Delete a movie
- `POST /api/movies/{id}/rating` - Rate a movie
- `GET /api/users/{userId}/ratings` - Get movie ratings for a user

Refer to the API documentation for detailed information on request and response formats.

## Using the Postman Collection

The project includes a Postman collection that helps you interact with the API endpoints for testing purposes. The collection is located in the project repository under the following path:

[Helpers/REST_API.postman_collection.json](./Helpers/REST_API.postman_collection.json)

The collection contains organized groups of requests for various operations like Identity, Movies, and Ratings. Follow these steps to import and use the Postman collection:

1. Download and install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) if you don't have it already.
2. Clone the GitHub repository or download the [Helpers/REST_API.postman_collection.json](./Helpers/REST_API.postman_collection.json) file to your local machine.
3. Open Postman and click on the "Import" button located in the top-left corner.
4. In the Import window, click on "Upload Files" and select the `REST_API.postman_collection.json` file you downloaded in step 2, then click "Import" to add the collection to your Postman workspace.
5. Once imported, you will see the collection named "API" in the left sidebar, containing three folders: Identity, Movies, and Ratings.

Follow the instructions provided in the previous response to generate a token, make authenticated requests, and interact with the API using the Postman collection.
